May 11th week:
- Reworked the lego houses generation
- Fixed ladder generation on front
- Now houses can have different sizes in width or depth
- Each "column" of rooms can have different heights
- Added different types of rooms like bedroom, living room, bathroom... (they have the same interior at this time but it is going to change)

For the next week:
- Change the ladder system so every room, especially the ones not in front, can be reached or find another solution
- Add different orientations
- Maybe improve already existing buildings
- Maybe add more types of rooms or different sizes of rooms
- And more

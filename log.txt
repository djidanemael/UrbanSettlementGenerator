April 6th week:
- 1st video meeting, the internship is about a competition on mcedit
- We will make and use python scripts to generate worlds as we want.
- For this week we have to understand the code and try to change something to make sure we understood.

April 13th week:
- First try on my own little structure, not working

May 11th week:
- Reworked the lego houses generation
- Fixed ladder generation on front
- Now houses can have different sizes in width or depth
- Each "column" of rooms can have different heights
- Added different types of rooms like bedroom, living room, bathroom... (they have the same interior at this time but it is going to change)

May 18th week:
- Added different orientations for rooms with the possibility to have the same one for every room
- Changed the ladder system so ladders reach the lowest height possible
- Tried to generate ladders in front of lower rooms to access higher ones without success (unwanted ladders appear in the air)
- Fixed rooftops coinciding

May 25th week:
- Fixed unwanted ladders
- Changed ladders generation so it happens after all rooms are generated to fix indoor ladders
- Separated ladders and door paths generations to fix missing these ones
- Fixed doors replaced by walls during generation
- Room orientation now checked before generation to avoid two rooms facing each other
- Changed path generation so it is made on the side with the highest number of doors on the ground

June 1st week:
- Fixed new indoor ladders (did not use new orientation so it just generated them in front and so indoor)
- Fixed path appearing in the sky and not on the ground (was made by bad entrance setting)
- Added new interiors following orientation (bedroom, kitchen, living room, dining room, reading room)

To do next:
- Maybe improve already existing buildings by applying lego logic to appartments

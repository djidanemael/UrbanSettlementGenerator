May 11th week:
- Reworked the lego houses generation
- Fixed ladder generation on front
- Now houses can have different sizes in width or depth
- Each "column" of rooms can have different heights
- Added different types of rooms like bedroom, living room, bathroom... (they have the same interior at this time but it is going to change)

May 18th week:
- Added different orientations for rooms with the possibility to have the same one for every room
- Changed the ladder system so ladders reach the lowest height possible
- Tried to generate ladders in front of lower rooms to access higher ones without success (unwanted ladders appear in the air)
- Fixed rooftops coinciding

May 25th week:
- Fixed unwanted ladders
- Changed ladders generation so it happens after all rooms are generated to fix indoor ladders
- Separated ladders and door paths generations to fix missing these ones
- Fixed doors replaced by walls during generation
- Room orientation now checked before generation to avoid two rooms facing each other
- Changed path generation so it is made on the side with the highest number of doors on the ground

For the next week:
- Fix missing ladders (see last screenshot)
- Fix path appearing in the sky and not on the ground
- Add other types of rooms and interior following orientation
- Maybe improve already existing buildings by applying lego logic to appartments
- And more

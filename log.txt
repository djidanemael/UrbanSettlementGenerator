May 11th week:
- Reworked the lego houses generation
- Fixed ladder generation on front
- Now houses can have different sizes in width or depth
- Each "column" of rooms can have different heights
- Added different types of rooms like bedroom, living room, bathroom... (they have the same interior at this time but it is going to change)

May 18th week:
- Added different orientations for rooms with the possibility to have the same one for every room
- Changed the ladder system so ladders reach the lowest height possible
- Tried to generate ladders in front of lower rooms to access higher ones without success (unwanted ladders appear in the air)
- Fixed rooftops coinciding

For the next week:
- Find a fix to unwanted ladders CHECKED (but missing some on west side due to room being generated over)
- Fix doors replaced by walls during generation CHECKED (maybe add window on opposite wall if a door is found)
- Add other building materials
- Maybe improve already existing buildings
- Maybe add more types of rooms or different sizes of rooms
- And more
